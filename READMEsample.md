  ## Description
  This application helps the user see the weather forecast for a city of the user's choosing. Searching for a valid city will show the current weather conditions including temperature, UV index, humidity, and wind speed. A 5-day forecast will also be displayed for the selected city. Searched cities will be saved in a list for quick reference.

  ## Installation
  The user will need to navigate to the webpage <https://maynperalta.github.io/MyWeatherApp/>. Once the webpage has loaded, the user will need to type a city name into the search bar in the upper left corner. Valid searched cities will generate buttons below the search bar that can be clicked in order to re-visit past cities. 
  <br/>

  ## Usage
  This project can be used to check weather data for a given city. This can help with planning events on the present day, or for planning events in target cities up to 5 days in advance. Determining if an event can be held outdoors is made easier by seeing what weather conditions will be.

  ## Tests
  Type a valid city to see weather conditions. The application uses the Open Weather Map API which allows cities from all over the world to be searched for weather data. If an invalid entry is submitted, an error message will appear. An error message will also appear if the city field is left blank, or a city without data in the API is entered.
